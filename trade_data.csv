However, opportunities to capitalize on temporary dips were missed, as reflected in the significant daily price swings. The focus on risk management aligns well with the uncertain market conditions.

3. **Suggestions for Improvement**: Although caution is necessary during periods of high greed, incorporating strategic, small-scale trades during market dips could enhance performance. Using technical indicators such as RSI and MACD selectively for timing these entries and exits might improve returns. Additionally, monitoring institutional activity through volume spikes can provide clues for more informed decisions.

3. **Suggestions for Improvement**: To enhance future trading strategies, consider small-scale tactical trades during market dips, guided by technical indicators like RSI for oversold conditions and MACD momentum shifts. Monitoring institutional activities and large order book imbalances can reveal pressure shifts and potential support levels, improving entry and exit timing.

Consider diversifying entry points with gradual buys to combat volatility. Monitoring large buy orders and bid sizes can provide additional support signals.

4. **Patterns/Trends:** The market exhibits persistent bearish pressure with dominant ask sizes over bid sizes, suggesting continued sell pressure. RSI levels hovering around low-to-mid 40s indicate oversold conditions, while MACD shows negative momentum.
